/*! Display in CSS */

/* The `display` property in Css is used to control how an HTML element is displayed on a page
Web. This property determines the type of box that is generated for an element and, consequently, its
behavior and design on the page. `display` can take several values, each with its own
representation and design rules. Some of the most common values of `display` are: */

/* 1. **`block`:** Elements with `display: block` are represented as rectangular blocks that
They take up the entire available width of your container. This means that they start on a new line and
They are stacked vertically, creating a separation between adjacent elements. */

/* 2. **`inline`:** Elements with `display: inline` are rendered on the same line as the content
surrounding, without creating a new line. They occupy only the space necessary for their content and do not allow
configure width or height properties. */

/* 3. **`inline-block`:** This option combines features of the `block` and `inline` elements. The
elements with `display: inline-block` are rendered on the same line, but allow setting
width and height properties, allowing them to behave like inline blocks. */

/* 4. **`none`:** Elements with `display: none` are not displayed on the page. It is as if the element
did not exist in the HTML code. It can be useful to hide elements dynamically using
JavaScript or CSS. */

/* 5. **`table`, `table-row`, `table-cell`, etc.:** These values are used to create elements with a
table-like box model. They are used to create table-type layouts when you are not
using a table structure in Html. */

/* 6. **`flex`:** The `display: flex` property is used to create a flexible layout model in a
container and allows automatic positioning and spacing of elements within it. This is
useful for designing more complex and flexible layouts. */

/* 7. **`grid`:** The `display: grid` property is used to create a grid layout model
in a container and allows you to control the arrangement and alignment of elements in a grid
two-dimensional. It is useful for more advanced grid layouts. */

/* These are just some examples of `display` values in CSS. Each value has a behavior
specific that affects the way elements on a web page are rendered and behave.
Choosing the value of `display` depends on your design needs and the structure of your page. */
