/*! Responsive Design in Css */

/* Responsive web design in Css is a technique used to create websites that adapt and
They display correctly on different devices and screen sizes, such as desktop computers,
tablets and mobile phones. This is achieved by using Css to control the layout and appearance
of the web page so that it automatically adjusts to the screen size of the user's device.
user. Here are some of the key techniques and concepts to achieve responsive web design in
Css. */

/* 1. **Media Queries**: Media queries are Css rules that allow specific styles to be applied to a
website based on the device screen size. For example, you can define a set of
styles for large screens and another set of styles for small screens. */

@media(max-width: 768px) {
    /* Styles for smaller screens (e.g. phones) */
  }
  @media (min-width: 769px) {
    /* Styles for larger screens (e.g. desktop computers) */
  }

/* 2. **Relative Units of Measurement**: Instead of using fixed units such as pixels, it is common to use
Relative units such as percentages or "em" to define font sizes and margins. This allows
elements scale proportionally to the size of the screen. */

container{
  font-size: 16px; /* Fixed font size */
  font-size: 1em; /* Font size relative to parent size */
}

/* 3. **Flexible Layout**: Use containers with flexible widths instead of fixed ones. This allows
elements fit the width of the screen. */

  .container {
    width: 100%; /* Flexible width */
    max-width: 1200px; /* Maximum width to prevent it from expanding too much */
  }

/* 4. **Responsive Images**: Make sure images are automatically resized based on the
screen size using the `max-width: 100%;` property. */

  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: self;
  }

/* 5. **Content Reordering**: You can use Flexbox or Grid to rearrange the content in p
smaller screens or apply rules for displaying/hiding elements. */

  .element {
    order: 2; /* Reorder element */
    display: none; /* Hide element */
  }

/* 6. **Multiple Device Testing**: You should always test your design on multiple devices and
screen sizes to make sure it looks and works correctly on all of them. */

/* 7. **CSS Frameworks**: You can also consider using Css frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation,
that provide pre-built tools and components to create responsive websites more
fast. */

/* Responsive web design is essential today, since most people access sites
web from a variety of devices. By applying these Css techniques, you can create an experience of
More consistent and friendly user on any device. */
