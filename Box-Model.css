/*! Box Model in Css */

/* The "box model" in Css refers to the way an Html element is visually represented,
including its content, padding, border and margin. The box model is used to calculate the size
total of an element and how it fits within its container. It is made up of four parts: */

/* 1. **Content (`content`):** This is the internal part of the element where the content is displayed, such as
text, images or any other element it contains. The size of the content is defined using the
`width` and `height` properties. */

/* 2. **Padding (`padding`):** Padding is the space between the content and the border of the element. Can
use the `padding` property to control the amount of space around the content. The filling is
lies within the total width and height of the element and is used to adjust the space between the
content and border. */

/* 3. **Border (`border`):** The border is the line or area that surrounds the content and the padding. Can
customize the border using the `border-width`, `border-style` and `border-color` properties.
The border is outside the total width and height of the element. */

/* 4. **Margin (`margin`):** The margin is the space between the border of the element and other elements in the
page. You can use the `margin` property to control the spacing between elements in the layout
of the page. The margin is outside the border. */

/* Here is an example of what the box model looks like in Css:

```
+---------------------+
| Margin |
| +-----------------+ |
| | Border | |
| | +-------------+ | |
| | | Padding | | |
| | | +---------+ | | |
| | | | Content | | | |
| | | +---------+ | | |
| | +-------------+ | |
| +-----------------+ |
| Margin |
+---------------------+
```

To control the box model in Css, you use properties like `width`, `height`, `padding`,
`border`, and `margin`. These properties allow you to define the size, spacing between elements, and
the edges of the elements, which is essential for the design of a web page. */
