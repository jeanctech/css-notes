/** Z-Index in CSS */

/* The `z-index` property in CSS is used to control the z-axis position (the depth) of
Overlay elements on a web page. It's especially useful when you have overlapping elements,
such as boxes, images or text, and you want to define which of them will be displayed on top of the others. The value
`z-index` determines the stacking order of the elements. */

/* The `z-index` property applies to elements with a position property other than `static`, that is
that is, elements with `position` set to `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`. Here
Do you have how to use `z-index` */

selector {
  z-index: value;
}

/* - `value`: An integer that determines the position on the z axis. The higher the number,
 The higher up the element will be in the stack of overlapping elements. */

div {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2; /* This element will be above elements with z-index 1 or less */
}

p {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1; /* This element will be after the element with z-index 2 */
}

/* It is important to note that `z-index` only has an effect on overlapping elements. If there is not
overlapping elements or if all elements have the same `z-index` value, then the
property has no visible effect. Additionally, `z-index` only affects elements contained in
the same stacking context, which is affected by other factors, such as
transformation and opacity properties. */

/* In situations of overlapping elements, `z-index` is a powerful tool to control the
visibility and interaction of elements on a web page. Note that a high `z-index` value
It does not necessarily mean that an element is "higher" in the visual layout; just control
which elements are displayed on top of others when they overlap. */
