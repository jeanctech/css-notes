/** Objects in CSS */

/* In CSS, objects are not a native or language-specific concept, unlike HTML and JavaScript
where objects are a fundamental part of language. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used
mainly to define the presentation and style of HTML elements on a web page.
Although you do not work directly with objects in CSS, you can often see concepts that are assimilated
to objects in the context of CSS. */

/* 1. **CSS Rules**: CSS rules are sets of properties and values that are applied to elements
HTML. You can think of a CSS rule as a set of style attributes that apply to a
specific HTML element or to a set of elements that match a selector. */

h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
}

/* 2. **Selectors**: Selectors in CSS are used to select one or more elements
HTML to which style rules will be applied. You can see them as criteria to "select" elements,
similar to how objects are selected in other languages. */

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* 3. **Classes and IDs**: In CSS, you can assign classes and IDs to HTML elements to apply styles
specific to those elements. This is similar to working with objects with unique identifiers. */

/*
 <div class="my-class">
    <!-- Contents -->
 </div>
 */

.my class {
  background-color: yellow;
}

#my-id {
  border: 1px solid red;
}

/* 4. **Properties and values**: Properties and values in CSS are similar to attributes and
methods in object-oriented programming. Properties define how a device should look or behave.
element, and the values are the specific settings. */

button {
  background-color: green;
  border: 2px solid black;
}

/* 5. **Inheritance**: CSS also includes the concept of inheritance, where styles can be inherited from
parent elements to child elements. This may be similar to the concept of property inheritance in
Object-oriented programming. */

/* These concepts in CSS can be related in some way to objects and object-oriented programming
objects in other languages, but CSS itself is not based on an object model. CSS is used
 mainly to apply styles to HTML documents, and focuses on describing how they should
elements appear on a web page. */
