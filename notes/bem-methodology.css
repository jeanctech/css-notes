/** Bem Methodology in CSS */

/* Bem stands for "Block Element Modifier" and is a naming convention
and popular methodology for writing maintainable and scalable CSS code. It was created by developers of
Yandex with the intention of improving the structure and organization of the CSS code, making it more
understandable and easy to maintain, especially on larger projects. */

/* Here is a brief explanation of each part of Bem */

/* Block: It is an independent and reusable component that represents a different part of the interface
of user. Blocks are usually represented by a class name, and must be named accordingly.
semantic way to describe its purpose. For example, a navigation menu, button, or
header could be considered blocks. */

.block {
  /* styles for the block */
  margin: 1rem;
}

/* Element : Elements are parts of the block that cannot be used separately from the block itself.
They are denoted by two underscores (__) followed by the element name. The elements are always part
of a block, and their class names are constructed using the block name as a prefix. */

.block__item {
  /* styles for the element */
  margin: 1rem;
}

/* Modifier: Modifiers are used to change the appearance or behavior of blocks
or elements. They are denoted by two dashes (--) followed by the name of the modifier. The modifiers
allow you to create variations of a block or element without duplicating CSS rules */

.block--modifier {
  /* styles for the block with the modifier applied */
  margin: 1rem;
}

.block__item--modifier {
  /* styles for the element with the modifier applied */
  margin: 1rem;
}

/* Here's an example of Bem in action:

 <div class="menu">
    <ul class="menu__list">
      <li class="menu__item">Home</li>
      <li class="menu__item menu__item--active">About</li>
      <li class="menu__item">Contact</li>
    </ul>
 </div>

*/

.menu {
  /* styles for the menu block */
  margin: 1rem;
}

.menu__list {
  /* styles for the menu list item */
  margin: 1rem;
}

.menu__item {
  /* styles for the menu item element */
  margin: 1rem;
}

.menu__item--active {
  /* styles for the active menu item element */
  margin: 1rem;
}

/* Using Bem helps create a clear and meaningful naming structure for CSS classes
, reduce the chances of style conflicts and improve maintainability and readability
of your code, especially as it grows in size and complexity.*/
