/** Width in CSS */

/* The `width` property in CSS is used to define the width of an HTML element, that is, how much space
horizontal will occupy an element on the web page. You can apply the `width` property to a variety of
HTML elements, such as divs, images, paragraphs, headers, and more. Here are some examples of how
It can be used: */

/* 1. **Fixed value in pixels:** */

div {
  width: 300px; /* The div will have a width of 300 pixels */
}

img {
  width: 100px; /* The image will have a width of 100 pixels */
}

/* 2. **Percentage of container width:** */

div {
  width: 50%; /* The div will occupy 50% of the width of its container */
}

/* 3. **Auto value:** */

/* You can use `width: auto;` to allow the element to automatically fit its contents.
For example, a paragraph will fit the width of its text content. */

p {
  width: self; /* The paragraph will fit the width of its content */
}

/* 4. **Maximum and minimum value:** */

/* You can define maximum and minimum values for the width of an element using `max-width` and `min-width`
This can be useful to control the size of an element within certain limits. */

div {
  max-width: 500px; /* The maximum width of the div is 500 pixels */
  min-width: 200px; /* The minimum width of the div is 200 pixels */
}

/* The `width` property is essential for web design and allows you to control the size of elements
on your page. You can adjust the width of the elements according to your design needs, either using
fixed values, percentages or configuring minimum and maximum limits. */
