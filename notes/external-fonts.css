/** External Fonts in CSS */

/* To use external fonts in CSS, you can do so using the `@font-face` property. This you
Allows you to include custom fonts on your website that are not available by default
in most systems. Below is an example of how to use external sources
in CSS */

/* 1. First, you must upload the custom font to your web server or use a font hosted on a
Font hosting service, such as Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts. Make sure you have access to the
font files (usually .woff or .woff2 files). */

/* 2. Next, define the custom font in your CSS stylesheet using `@font-face`. TO
Below is an example: */

@font-face {
  font-family: "MyCustomFont";
  src: url("path-to-my-source.woff2") format("woff2");
  /* Optional: You can include other supported font formats here */
}

/* 3. After defining the font, you can apply it to elements of your web page by specifying the name
 of the custom font in the `font-family` property. For example. */

body {
  font-family: "MyCustomFont", sans-serif;
}

/* In this example, the custom font is defined with the name 'MyCustomFont' and applied
 to all `body` elements of the page. If the custom font does not load correctly or
 is available, a generic fallback font specified in `sans-serif` will be used. */

/* 4. Make sure you provide the correct path to the source file in the `src` property. You can too
 include multiple font formats (such as woff and woff2) to ensure greater compatibility between
 browsers. */

/* It is important to remember that, in many cases, it is advisable to use external sources hosted on
 services such as Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, or Font Awesome, as they simplify font management and
 They guarantee high availability and compatibility on different browsers and devices. */
