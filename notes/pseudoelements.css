/** PseudoElements in CSS */

/* Pseudo-elements in CSS are selectors that allow you to access specific parts of an element
HTML and apply styles to those parts. These pseudo-elements are used to create visual effects,
such as adding content before or after the content of an element, styling the first letter or line
of a paragraph, or selecting the first child or last child of an element. The pseudo-elements
are represented by a double colon `::` and are used in combination with selectors to point to
specific parts of an element. */

/* Some examples of common pseudo-elements are: */

/* 1. **`::before`:** This pseudo-element is used to insert content before the content of a
element. You can use it to add elements, such as icons or decorative text, before the content
main of the element. */

p::before {
  content: "ðŸ“¢ "; /* Add a megaphone emoji before paragraphs */
}

/* 2. **`::after`:** This pseudo-element is used to insert content after the content of
 an element. Like `::before`, you can add decorative or functional content to the end of a
 element. */

a::after {
  content: " (external link)"; /* Add text after external links */
}

/* 3. **`::first-letter`:** This pseudo-element is used to stylize the first letter of a
element. You can apply special styles to the first letter of a paragraph, such as a font size.
larger font or a different color. */

p::first-letter {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: blue;
}

/* 4. **`::first-line`:** This pseudo-element is used to style the first line of an element.
You can apply styles to the first line of a paragraph, such as adjusting line spacing or size
of source. */

p::first-line {
  line-height: 1.5;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* 5. **`::selection`: This pseudo-element is used to apply styles to the text selected by
the user on a web page. You can change the background color and text color of the selection. */

::selection {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: black;
}

/* These are just some examples of pseudo-elements in CSS. Pseudo-elements allow you to have
greater control and precision when applying styles to specific parts of your elements' content
HTML, which is useful for creating custom visual effects and styles on your website. */
