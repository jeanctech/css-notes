/** Text Properties in CSS */

/* In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), you can use text properties to control the appearance and
text formatting on your web page. These properties allow you to specify things like the color of the text,
font size, line spacing, alignment and many other visual features
of the text. Here are some common text properties */

/* 1. `color`: This property is used to set the color of the text. You can specify the color in
name form (e.g. "red" for red), hexadecimal value (#FF0000 for red), or RGB value
(rgb(255, 0, 0) for red). */

p {
  color: blue;
}

/* 2. `font-size`: Controls the font size of the text. You can specify the size in pixels,
ems, percentages or other units of measurement. */

p {
  font-size: 16px;
}

/* 3. `font-family`: This property defines the font family that will be used for the text. Can
provide a list of preferred sources, separated by commas. */

  font-family: "Arial", sans-serif;
}

/* 4. `font-weight`: Controls the weight of the font, such as "bold" or "normal." */

p {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* 5. `text-align`: Defines the alignment of the text in the element, such as "left", "center"
